Programming Project 1(A) and 1(B) The linked list - Reference: chapter 17:

1 (A)

  a. Create a linked list of 20 student records. Each node is a node of one
student record.

  b. Each student record consists of student ID, student name, Student address,
and GPA.

  c. The student records must be defined as student object class with member
functions of APPEND and DISPLAY.

  d. Display the linked list of student records.

  e. You need to turn in hard copy of source program and output of the linked
list of student records.

     For all assignments in my class:
     You may optionally use template or container in C++ if you wish.
     You may use Java if you wish. Please high light on the turn in if you do
either or both.

1 (B) [Make it a doubly linked list.] [display from back]

  f. Create a linked list of 20 student records.

  g. The input records should not be sorted.

  h. The output of the linked list should be sorted by using "insert" and
"append" functions. Display both the unsorted input and sorted output records.

  i. Delete the 15th record from the sorted list and display the resulted sorted
list.

  j. Insert a 10th record and display the resulted sorted list.

  k. Turn in with hard copy and must be professional and the turn in should
include the source Program, and the 4 displayed outputs - unsorted records, the
sorted list, the list after deletion, the list after insertion.
