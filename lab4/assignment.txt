Project 4

(DUE March 6 2013) / Well, THAT slipped by.

Binary Search and Recursion

- Create a file of at least 20 student records sorted by student id.

- Read student records into a vector in C++ or Java program.

- Student records should include Student ID, Name, GPA, Student Address, and a 
  pointer which point to (10+) test scores somewhere in the program.

- Display the 20+ student records (not just ID) and related test scores.

- Use recursive binary search to search a student-ID in the vector.

- Use recursive binary search to search a student-ID at the end of the vector.

- Use recursive binary search to search a student-ID which is not in the vector.

For each search, print the ID to be searched and the searched result with the found record.
